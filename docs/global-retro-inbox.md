# Global Retro Inbox

Tracker-class artifact. No lifecycle frontmatter — status is its content,
same treatment as `OPEN-ITEMS.md` and `BACKLOG-v2.md`.

## Purpose

Raw, timestamped capture of methodology-level observations as they occur —
not tied to any single project. This is candidate material, not a decision
record and not a methodology change. Anything here that becomes a real
proposal still enters through the normal spec-review cycle
(`skills/spec-review-cycle.md`) — no second door.

Distinct from `skills/conversation-retro.md`, which governs per-project,
per-conversation, evidence-grounded retrospectives stored in each project's
`retros/`. This file is global, freeform, and append-only at capture time;
schema/synthesis discipline applies later, when an entry is actually worked.

## Entries

### 2026-08-04

- **Per-project decision log.** Every project should have a decision log;
  agents acting as arbiters should write to it, using a consistent schema,
  for every non-trivial decision. Two distinct benefits, not one: (1)
  agents facing a plausible-options choice check it first instead of
  re-deciding; (2) accepted tradeoffs stop getting relitigated — an agent
  rediscovering known problem X on something already knowingly accepted
  should find the entry and stand down, not raise it as a fresh finding.
  (2) maps to the existing `Accepted risk` term in `context-sets/base.md`
  rather than needing new vocabulary.
  Sketch discussed: per-project, tracker-class (`decisions/`, storage
  family matches `retros/`), one immutable file per decision —
  never edited, only superseded by a new entry. Two entry types:
  `decision` and `accepted-risk`. Schema roughly: id, date,
  decision-maker (role), status (proposed/decided/superseded), context,
  options considered, decision, rationale, consequences, related
  decisions.
  Non-trivial threshold agreed: spec/ACs didn't fully determine the
  choice — a different competent agent could plausibly have chosen
  differently (architecture/design approach, dependency/tool choice,
  data model/interface shape, deviation from stated methodology or
  precedent). Anything in the commit-and-change-control consequential
  class is automatically non-trivial too. Trivial: naming, formatting,
  mechanical refactors, anything the spec fully dictates, anything
  already captured as a review-artifact finding.
  Behavioral implication flagged, not yet drafted: this needs a *consult*
  obligation in agent behavior (likely `base.md` Required Behavior), not
  just a write schema — check the log before deciding, check for a
  matching `accepted-risk` before raising a finding, propose reopening
  explicitly rather than silently re-raising.
  Dave's disposition: don't draft the skill yet. Hold this for a batch
  evaluation alongside upcoming retros — expects several inbox/retro
  items will cluster into a single spec-review pass more efficiently
  than one-off handling.

### 2026-08-04 (2)

- **Portable `/retro`-style capture command, per repo.** A few-keystrokes
  invocation ("`/retro <note>`" or similar) that tells the LLM to append
  the note to that repo's inbox — the same mechanism just built ad hoc in
  this chat (`docs/global-retro-inbox.md`), generalized into something
  every repo gets, including `davepierceops/ai` itself. Would apply
  equally to project repos' `retros/`-adjacent capture and to this repo's
  global inbox.
  Relationship to existing artifacts: distinct from
  `skills/conversation-retro.md` (whole-conversation, evidence-grounded,
  triggered at a natural end) and from the decision-log idea above
  (structured, schema'd, decision-specific). This is the lightest-weight
  of the three — arbitrary freeform notes, low-friction, no schema at
  capture time.
  Dave's observation: once this exists for the `ai` repo itself, this
  chat thread (used as an ad hoc inbox front-end) becomes unnecessary —
  the command replaces it.
  Not drafted yet — batching with the decision-log item and upcoming
  retros per the prior entry's disposition.

### 2026-08-04 (3)

- **Standing behavior: self-contained test paste-blocks from sandboxed
  coder agents.** Dave repeatedly has to tell coder agents running inside
  Claude Code sandboxes: give me a paste-block that writes to files you
  control, not one that expects me to copy-paste output back to you. When
  a coder agent asks Dave to run tests outside the sandbox (e.g. against a
  live service, browser, or anything the sandbox can't reach), the
  paste-block it hands him should write its own output to a file/log the
  agent already has access to — not print to Dave's terminal for him to
  relay back manually. Proposed as standard behavior, not a one-off
  reminder each time.
  Likely home: a required-behavior line in `context-sets/base.md` (agent
  behavior, cross-role) or a role doc for the Coder specifically — not yet
  decided, batching per prior entries' disposition.

### 2026-08-04 (4)

- **Open question for retro consolidation: is GitHub MCP flakiness still
  real?** A lot of existing directives (MCP write-verification via
  independent fetch, timeout-recovery-by-reading-HEAD-first, small-writes-
  only during spec-review cycles) exist to handle GitHub MCP being flaky.
  Dave thinks this may have just been fixed but isn't sure. Action, not
  just an observation: **at retro-consolidation time, ask Dave whether he
  still believes it's fixed.** If yes, audit the above directives for ones
  that only exist to work around a problem that no longer exists, and
  propose removing/loosening them through the normal spec-review cycle.
  Do not preemptively relax any of the existing verification directives
  before that confirmation — this entry is a flag to revisit, not a
  decision to relax anything yet.
  (Mildly on the nose: GitHub MCP timed out three times in a row while
  logging this exact entry, before succeeding on retry.)

### 2026-08-05

- **Ticket-system topic for next retro: near-zero-friction ticket capture.**
  Dave needs a way to get small, quick items into a ticket system with
  effort on the order of "open tool, type five words, leave" — not a
  workflow that requires enough context-switch/ceremony that low-cycle
  moments just get dropped instead of captured. Distinct from this
  chat/inbox mechanism (which is for methodology-level retro material);
  this is about day-to-day project ticket creation (presumably GitHub
  Issues, per existing tooling, though the actual system isn't decided
  here). Not scoped or drafted — parked as a discussion topic for the
  next retro, not a design yet.

### 2026-08-07

- **Skill docs drift into persuasive register at a length that may hurt
  adherence.** `directive-dispatch.md` was long and persuasive rather than
  brief and directive — rules followed by paragraph-long justifications, war
  stories, meta-commentary. Dave's real-world observation: CoS often does not
  follow the skill closely, and length may be part of why. A compression pass
  this session ("make things less persuasive, shorter, and more directive")
  cut it ~46% (3071→1653 words) with every rule, the model table, and both
  command blocks preserved. Method: state the rule directively, cut the
  argument for it; where a rule's only record of a real failure was its war
  story, cut the story and rely on the external pointer (decision log, retro,
  the policy the rule already cites). Hypothesis to test: if CoS follows the
  compressed version noticeably better, that is evidence the *whole skill
  corpus* wants this pass. Candidate batch item: a directive-register
  compression sweep across all skills, with a shared "state the rule, cut the
  argument" convention captured somewhere governing (LEXICON or a meta-skill
  on how skills are written). The compressed `directive-dispatch.md` landed
  this session (commit 3e2487a).

- **Track B procedure gaps found by running it for real (first real Track B
  run).** Four distinct fixes, all landed in `directive-dispatch.md` this
  session except where noted:
  - *Download relocation.* The desktop client ignores chosen download location
    and writes to `~/Downloads`, appending a collision suffix (`name (1).md`)
    on name clash. Old mechanics assumed a chosen path. New flow: pre-flight
    `ls` establishes what is present, relocate block moves the exact filename
    into place and never inspects the destination (so it is correct for edits
    to existing files, not just new files), standalone sync block dropped.
  - *Pre-flight glob was wrong.* Globbed `<name>.md*` — but the collision
    suffix lands *before* the extension (`directive-dispatch (1).md`), so that
    glob misses every collision copy. Fix: glob on the **stem**
    (`<stem>*`). Dave's test caught this: four files present, the buggy glob
    matched one. Also reframed: the pre-flight surfaces state for Dave to
    judge, it is not a machine "count equals one" check, because a stem glob
    also catches legitimately-different files sharing the stem.
  - *Stale-artifact-in-pane hazard.* The reply carrying the pre-flight/relocate
    blocks must ALSO present the exact file those blocks move, in the same
    turn. Across a long session the artifact pane holds whatever was shown
    last; blocks referencing "the file" while a different file is displayed is
    a silent wrong-file hazard. Rule: artifact and blocks ship together or not
    at all. (Not yet written into the doc — batch item.)
  - *Emit the canonical filename as a copyable atom.* For a sharp operator,
    handing just the filename (its own paste-box, nothing else) is often more
    useful than a canned `ls`/`rm`/`cp` block — they assemble the verb around
    it faster than they can read a supplied block. Split: hand the name as an
    atom for operator-judged inspection steps; reserve whole tested blocks for
    load-bearing steps (the relocate/commit). (Not yet in the doc — batch
    item.)
  - *Append vs. replace.* The doc's Track B mechanics only cover whole-file
    replacement (`mv`). Appending to an existing tracker (like this inbox) is a
    different operation with a different re-run hazard: naive `cat >>` run
    twice appends twice. Needs a marker-guarded append (skip if the entry's
    dated heading already present). (Not yet in the doc — batch item.)

- **`bin/dispatch` deferral reasoning updated.** The doc previously said "Track
  B has never been run" as grounds not to build tooling. It has now been run
  (this session), and the run reshaped the relocate block. Claim corrected in
  the doc; build triggers restated (block stabilises across enough runs, or
  first hand-tweak needed).

- **Cross-corpus duplication / drift audit — its own tranche.** Noticed while
  compressing base + operating-model: the same rules are restated across base,
  operating-model, and spec-and-change-discipline (evidence vocabulary,
  meaningful-change definition, the canonical change-flow sequence). The right
  question is not "make operating-model shorter" but "what is duplicated, and
  is each duplication intentional?" Three bins for every restated rule:
  (1) **load-bearing repetition** — restated on purpose so a rule stays salient
  when an agent reaches the moment from different entry points; keep, possibly
  mark as intentional so it is not later "helpfully" de-duped. LLM adherence can
  genuinely benefit from repetition — do not reflexively DRY.
  (2) **coincidental restatement** — same fact in two docs because they grew
  independently; pure drift-risk (edit one, the other goes stale and
  contradicts); eliminate to one canonical home + pointer.
  (3) **should-differ** — looks duplicated but the instances differ subtly and
  should, or one is wrong; the valuable finds — latent contradictions surfaced.
  Test for (1) vs (2): "is this worth enforcing hard enough to hit the agent
  from multiple angles?" yes → intentional; no reason → coincidental.
  Scope is the full governed set (~30 docs: context-sets, roles, policies,
  skills, boundaries, operating-model, README, LEXICON), not just the three
  noticed in passing — those three were where the spidey-sense fired, not the
  boundary of the problem. Method must be **mechanical-first**: a script
  extracts candidate duplications (normalized rules appearing in 2+ docs) for
  completeness — an LLM read-through of 30 docs misses pairs, and a half-done
  drift audit is worse than none because it implies coverage it lacks — then
  humans tag each candidate bin 1/2/3, since intent is not string-detectable.
  Methodology-consistent: candidates are *computed from the corpus*, not a
  hand-maintained list (which would itself drift); the script becomes a reusable
  `bin/` drift check, not a one-shot. Compression of operating-model and
  spec-and-change-discipline is deliberately deferred behind this — compressing
  text you are about to de-duplicate is wasted motion. Not scoped; own tranche.

- **`bin/bundle` should emit the full pinned-header bundle, not just the body.**
  Regenerating the methodology context bundle is currently a hand-assembled
  shell block: `bin/bundle --format concat` produces only the body with a
  `===== path @ sha =====` separator, while the uploaded artifact needs the
  header (title, "do not edit", `Source: @ <repo-sha>`, `Generated: <stamp>`,
  the file-set rule statement), the numbered file list with per-file blob
  short-SHAs, and `<!-- FILE n/N: path @ sha -->` separators. That wrapper is
  reconstructed by hand each regen, which is how a stale bundle cut from the
  wrong commit (`4e4e01b`, pre-merge) got uploaded earlier this session, and how
  a shell history-expansion `!` corrupted all 33 separators in another attempt.
  Both are failure modes a script removes. Proposed: a `bin/bundle` mode (or new
  `bin/bundle-methodology`) that takes the fixed spine + the audience-keyed
  skills rule, resolves current HEAD, and writes the complete
  `methodology-context-bundle-<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>.md` in one command — filename
  timestamp and blob SHAs correct-by-construction. The file-set rule is already
  encoded in the header prose; the script makes it executable. Timestamped
  filename is intentional (project-view version visibility; overrides the
  no-derived-metadata-in-names default — Dave). Still a manual step after:
  upload to each project's Context and delete the prior bundle, since uploads
  are per-project and same-name re-upload does not propagate across projects
  (observed this session). Not scoped; candidate for the same tooling tranche as
  the drift-audit `bin/` check.

### 2026-08-09

- **Directives should pin in-scope documents by commit SHA, not blob SHA.** The
  cycle-2 reversal directives pinned the three docs by `git rev-parse HEAD:<path>`
  blob hashes (`435ebc4`, `cd7a7fd`, `fc9f49b`). The executor could confirm the
  tree matched only via `git hash-object`; blob SHAs do not resolve as commits,
  so `git show <sha>:<path>`, ancestry checks, and `git log`-based staleness
  guards all fail on them — the very verification `skills/directive-dispatch.md`
  assumes an executor can run. Later directives in the same sequence switched to
  commit-SHA pins (`<path> @ <40-char commit SHA>`) and the friction vanished.
  Proposed: `skills/directive-dispatch.md` state explicitly that in-scope-document
  pins are commit SHAs. AC-CO-4 already requires the `bin/cycle-open` tool to emit
  full commit SHAs; the hand-authored directive path lacked the equivalent rule.

- **Pre-stage the dispatch line at PR-open time, not after merge.** Track A as
  written has the author read the post-merge SHA back from git and hand the
  dispatch line in a second turn — a round-trip after every directive merge.
  Because merges are merge-commits, the directive's content-commit SHA stays in
  main's history after merge, so the dispatch line can be emitted (pinned to that
  content SHA) in the same reply that opens the PR: operator merges, then runs, no
  return trip. Adopted mid-session at the operator's prompting. This is the
  discipline the deferred `bin/dispatch` is meant to make unskippable (it stamps
  the git-read SHA into the block); until it ships, the manual Track A flow should
  pre-stage the line. Caveat: valid only under merge-commit merges — a
  squash/rebase drops the content commit, and the pinned SHA then fails loudly on
  sync (safe, not silently wrong).
