# Skill: System Discovery

Procedure for building the System Map of a client pipeline. Executed by the
Cartographer, read-only throughout.

## Procedure

1. **Inventory the sources.** Repositories, workflow files, Terraform,
   container image definitions, delivery pipelines, dashboards, runbooks, and
   any statements client humans have made (as relayed by Dave). List what
   exists before reading deeply.
2. **Reconstruct the pipeline under study.** From trigger to ready: what event
   starts it, what stages execute, in what order, on what infrastructure, with
   what dependencies between them. Cite the file and line that establishes
   each link.
3. **Tag every claim** with provenance: observed, inferred, told, or unknown
   (`../roles/cartographer.md`). The unknowns become the question list for
   Dave.
4. **Identify the measurement points.** For each stage: where would a
   timestamp come from — existing logs, CI APIs, workflow annotations? Prefer
   measurement that requires no changes at all; then measurement requiring
   only PR-able changes; flag anything that would need write access.
5. **Render the map.** One document: pipeline narrative, stage table, claim
   provenance, unknowns, proposed measurement plan. Small enough to read in
   one sitting; everything else links out.

## Output

`system-map.md` in the engagement working repo — a Comfy-hosted repo
designated at kickoff, so the client's governance holds the client's data —
plus the unknowns list ready for CoS triage. The map is a living document:
corrections from later evidence amend it, and amendments note what earlier
belief they replaced.

## Failure modes to avoid

- reading everything before rendering anything — map incrementally
- flattening provenance: "the deploy takes ten minutes" told by a human and
  observed in logs are different claims
- letting the map editorialize; recommendations belong to proposals, not maps
