# Skill: Boundary Audit

This procedure runs in an execution session.

## Purpose

Identify where the system's tests, mocks, tools, or assumptions stop proving production behavior.

## Use when

- adding or changing a mock
- adding or changing an external integration
- changing auth/config/deployment behavior
- reviewing a green test suite before release
- investigating a surprise production/manual failure
- verifying that SLO targets defined in the TRD have a production monitoring
  mechanism in place

## Inputs

- change summary
- test plan
- relevant tests/mocks
- external dependencies
- release context

## Procedure

1. List all affected production behaviors.
2. Identify which behaviors are tested locally.
3. Identify which tests use mocks, fixtures, a headless DOM, fakes, or
   generated data.
4. For each boundary, state what is verified.
5. For each boundary, state what is not verified.
6. Assign a deferred verification path.
7. Mark each unresolved gap with one of LEXICON's four release impact labels.
