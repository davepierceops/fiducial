# Policy: Decision Log

This policy governs decision sessions: appending to the log is decision-session
work.

## Purpose

So a decision made once can be found and honored — not silently re-litigated or
contradicted because no one knew it existed. The log is the one place a
decision resolves to.

## The log

Each project keeps one append-only log at `decisions/log.md`. The methodology
repo keeps its own, for methodology decisions.

One file, not one file per entry — the single file *is* the index. Entries are
appended; existing entries are never edited or deleted.

## Entry format

```markdown
## DEC-000070 — <short title>
Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
Decision: <the ruling, one or two sentences>
Context: <the problem it settled, briefly>
Supersedes: DEC-000030   (omit if none)
```

- **ID** — `DEC-NNNNNN`, assigned in steps of 10 starting at `DEC-000010`,
  unique within the project's log, never reused. It is the resolvable handle:
  `grep DEC-000070 decisions/log.md` lands on the entry. A cited decision with no
  defined path back to its definition is the defect this log removes.
- **Context** carries the *why* so a reader can consult the decision without
  reopening the cycle chat it came from.
- Decisions are Dave's; there is no "who" field.

**Assigning an ID.** Read the log — you are opening it to append anyway — take
the last entry's number, add ten. Append-only guarantees the last entry holds
the highest ID, so last-plus-ten is always the next free number.

**Resolving a duplicate ID.** If two entries ever land on the same number
(concurrent appends), renumber the later ones by +1 *within the gap* —
`DEC-000410` → `DEC-000411`, `DEC-000412` — never by another ten. The step of
ten exists for exactly this: there is always room to bump a collision without
disturbing its neighbours.

## Reversal and supersession

To change or reverse a decision, append a new entry whose `Supersedes:` names
the old ID. The old entry stays as the historical record. Whether a decision is
still live is answered by searching its ID in later `Supersedes:` lines.
