# Lexicon

Terms with a fixed meaning across this methodology.

Governed like any canonical document: changes enter through a review cycle.

**The touch rule:** any file edited for another reason is conformed to this
lexicon as part of that edit.

## Spec state

**Tranche** — one concurrent workstream of build work.

**Spec branch** — the branch a tranche's spec edits land on, named
`spec/<tranche-slug>`. Git is the machinery; there is no status value for this
and no register recording it. The branch existing, with commits on it, is the
state.

**Open spec delta** — the interval during which a tranche's spec branch carries
edits that the default branch does not. During it Dave edits spec documents
freely, with no reviewer gate and no per-edit ceremony. A delta is bounded by
its tranche and never spans two.

**Reconciliation** — closing a delta: the spec is brought to full agreement with
what was actually built, and the whole accumulated diff goes through the
reviewer gate **once** — once per delta, not once per edit — arriving on the
default branch as a pull request. Agreement attaches here, to the version of
record. The default branch therefore never carries unreviewed spec text, and
`agreed` there never lies.

**Claimed** — of a spec document: appearing in an open delta's diff. A claimed
document may not be claimed by a second open delta.

## Evidence classes

The classes an evidence claim is labelled with. Every verification claim carries
one.

**Mock-verified** — against controlled or simulated inputs.

**Contract-verified** — against a documented or encoded interface contract.

**Live-verified** — against a real external system or deploy-like service.

**Browser-verified** — in a real browser environment.

**Production-verified** — through deployed telemetry, monitoring, synthetic
checks, logs, or real production signals.

**Unverified** — known but not yet checked.

**Deferred verification** — intentionally postponed, with a named future
mechanism.

**Accepted risk** — an explicit decision to proceed despite a known gap.

## Release impact labels

The labels a known gap is marked with at the release decision. Every material
boundary gap carries one.

**`blocking`** — a gap the governing policies prohibit releasing with; must be
resolved before release. A gap awaiting Dave's judgment is not blocking by that
fact alone — it reaches him through the release package; "requires Dave
decision" is not a label.

**`deferred`** — intentionally postponed with a named mechanism.

**`accepted-risk`** — Dave or the release process has explicitly accepted the
gap.

**`not-material`** — known but not relevant to the release decision.

## Claim axes

**Claim strength** — how firmly a sentence in public prose may assert. Four
tiers, named by the Public Prose Criteria: *relayed*, *demonstrated*,
*grounded*, *opinion*. A property of the assertion, not of where the knowledge
came from.

**Provenance class** — where an assertion came from. Four classes, named by
Core: *observed*, *inferred*, *told*, *unknown*.

The two are independent axes: a *grounded* claim may be *observed*, and an
*opinion* may be *told*.

**Tier** — used on two axes, never interchangeably. A **model tier** is
frontier, solid general-purpose, or cheap. A **claim tier** is one of the four
claim-strength tiers above. Say which is meant.

## Service levels

**Top K** — the K most important user journeys of a product. The list is defined
once, in the PRD; the TRD sets SLO targets against it and does not redefine it.
Where a document requires SLO status or error budget accounting "for Top K
journeys," it means that list.

## Retired terms

**Prompt** — not a term of this methodology. What is meant is one of:

- **What a decision session hands an execution session** — a *directive*; its
  committed form is a *directive file*, its transport is an *execution block*,
  and one direction inside it is an *instruction*.
- **What a decision session hands its successor decision session** — a *baton*.
- **What a directive points the executor at** — a *companion document*.
- **What runs in a shell** — a *command block*.
- **What a session loads as standing context** — a *context set*, a *role
  document*, a *skill document*, a *policy*, a *boundary document*.
- **What a session derives work from** — the *decomposition doc*, a *change
  package*, the *acceptance criteria*, the *spec* (PRD/TRD).
- **Inbound material a session acts on** — the specific name of that material:
  *reviewer findings*, a *review artifact*, an *execution report*, an *upload*,
  a *retro*.

*Not covered by this retirement:* an approval **prompt** — a tool interrupting
to ask a human to authorise a step. That is a different word in a different
domain, and it keeps its ordinary meaning.

**Dispatch** — retired 2026-08-21. Write "hand the directive to an execution
session," or "direct."

**Sync block** — retired 2026-08-21. Nothing precedes the execution block; the
executor fetches as its first act.

**Track** — retired 2026-08-21. A directive's parts are route, model tier, and
the execution block; "track" is not one of them.

*Not covered by this retirement:* **track**, **tracking**, and **tracker** in
the ordinary sense of keeping or consulting a record — a loose-end tracker, a
tracker issue, error budget tracking, SLO tracking. Those are a different word
in a different domain, and they keep their ordinary meaning.
